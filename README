Operating Systems Project 2

This program currently is not complete, so it does not fully execute the project.

This program, currently, creates shared memory that has 5 buffers and a buffer flag array,
a flag array, and a turn variable.

It then creates a producer and a consumer. The producer reads the input file and attaches shared memory,
checks to ensure that the shared memory buffer isn't full and then fills the buffer, setting the buffer
flag to be full. It then detaches shared memory and closes the file.

The consumer attaches shared memory, waits for the buffer to be full, then prints the buffer to the screen.


Currently, make the program by typing:
make all

Then, run the program by executing:
./master
